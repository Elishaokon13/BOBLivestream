# POAP on Base - Workshop Project

## Background and Motivation
Building a POAP (Proof of Attendance Protocol) application on Base using Base Minikit. This app will allow users to mint POAPs as proof of attending events/workshops. The POAP will be implemented as a Soulbound Token (SBT) with a limit of 1 per address, ensuring each attendee can only have one non-transferable token. The project needs to be completed within a 3-hour workshop timeframe, focusing on core functionality while leveraging Base Minikit's built-in features.

## Workshop Details
- Name: "BUILD ON BASE CHALLENGE - BORDERLESS WORKSHOPS"
- Type: Workshop Attendee Badge
- Visual: Blue circular badge with Base home icon
- Metadata Storage: On-chain

- End Date: June 25, 2025 (1719331200) // Unix timestamp
- Network: Base Mainnet
- **Contract Address: 0xd3F581adEF8b654b7ed08F3aD43fEd0fC359b117** âœ… **DEPLOYED**
